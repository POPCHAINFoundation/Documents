# CryptoPop: A One-Way Function for Proof-of-Work  

In this paper, we present a one-way function CryptoPop, which is friendly to CPU architectures, but NOT to GPUs, FPGAs or ASICs.  


## 1. Design of One-way Function CryptoPop  
### 1.1 Principles
In order to resist efficiently implementation on GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs, the design of CryptoPop should satisfy following features:  
1. More memory size than common hash functions. Considering the cache size of CPUs, the memory size for CryptoPop is 1MB.  
2. A lot of memory accesses in random mode.  
3. High serialization and control dependence to prevent parallel execution in the function.  
4. Using 16 different types of one-way function to increase the chip area for ASIC implementation.  

### 1.2 Design of One-way Function CryptoPop  
We use following definitions in our paper:  
[Definition 1] One-Way function y=CryptoPop(x), the output y is 256 bits.  
[Definition 2] One-Way function family hi，0≤i≤15. The input of each function is 256 bits, except h0, which can accept arbitrary length input. The output of each function is 256 bits.  
[Definition 3] Pseudorandom number generator. seed(uint48 s) sets the seed, and rand() returns random result in 48 bits. We choose linear congruential generator Xn+1 = (aXn + c) mod m,  n ≥0，where a =25214903917, c = 11, m = 248 (rand48() in glibc).  
[Definition 4] Working memory M with size of |M| bytes. We choose |M|=1M=220.  
[Definition 5] reduce_bit(x, y) to reduce input x to output in y bits. The length of x is l bits，satisfied with l≥y。x is expanded X to L bits, where L mod y =0 and X[L-1:l]=0. X is split into L/y segments in y bits. The output is *XOR* of all segments.  
[Definition 6] RRS(x, y) to rotate shift right x with y bits.  

The one-way function CryptoPop includes three algorithms:   
1. Initialize the working memory M.  
2. Modify the content of M.  
3. Generate the output according to the content of M.  

**[Alg-1] Initialize the working memory M**  
Input  :  x  	The input of one-way function y=CryptoPop(x)  
Output： M 	Working memory    
Parameters: K   To adjust the computation speed. Larger K implies faster.  
Variables:  
a, b  vectors in 32 bytes，a[c1:c2] means the content of a from c1 to c2  
i    32-bit unsigned integer  
1. a[0:31]=h0(x);   
2. loop, i from 0 to |M|/32-1 	//if |M|=1M, the loop count is 215  
2.1  if i mod K ≠0      	//K is a configurable parameter to adjust speed  
2.1.1   	b[0 : 7] = rand0()*xor*(rand0()<<16);   
2.1.2   	b[8 :15] = rand1()*xor*(rand1()<<16);   
2.1.3   	b[16:23]= rand2()*xor*(rand2()<<16);   
2.1.4   	b[24:31]= rand3()*xor*(rand3()<<16);  
2.1.5  	b[0 : 31]= RRS(b[0:31], reduce_bit(i,8));  
2.1.6  	M[32*i:32*i+31]=b[0:31];  
2.1.7   	a[0:31]= a[0:31] *xor* b[0: 31];  
2.2  else  
2.2.1   	t=reduce_bit(a[0:31],4);  
2.2.2   	a[0:31]=ht(RRS(a[0:31], reduce_bit(i,8)));  
2.2.3   	seed0(reduce_bit(a[ 0: 7],48)); 	seed1(reduce_bit(a[ 8:15],48));   
seed2(reduce_bit(a[16:23],48)); 	seed3(reduce_bit(a[24:31],48));  
2.2.4   M[32*i:32*i+31]= a[0:31];  



**Comment on Alg-1**  
This algorithm will generate the random content in |M| bytes for working memory. In step 2, 32 bytes will be generated in one loop. Consecutive K-1 blocks are generated from random generator (in step 2.1), and one block from one-way function family (in step 2.2). Because the speed of random generator is faster than one-way functions, increasing K can reduce the frequentness of calling one-way functions to increase the fulfill speed of working memory.  
In random fulfilling (from step 2.1.1 to 2.1.4), there are four independent generators to produce a 32-byte block with a rotate shift in variable bits (step 2.1.5). Two factors determine the content of the 32-byte block: 1) Four 48-bit seeds; 2) loop control variable i. So the number of all possible input to fulfill one block is 296+15=2111.  
When calling one-way function (step 2.2.2), whose input depend on latest output of one-way function and the content of previous K-1 blocks (step 2.1.7). It results in the computation of one-way function must be followed random fulfill.  The number of all possible input of one-way function is 2256+8=2264.  
In step 2.2.3, the seeds of four generators are updated according to the output of the one-way function. It requires that the following random fulfill must run after one-way function.  
It can be seen that alg-1 is satisfied: 1) execution sequentially; 2) impossible to predict the content of one block.

b: 64-byte array; a: 32-byte array   
1. a[0:31]=c[0:31]=h0(M[|M|-32:|M|-1]); r=reduce_bit(a[0:31], 64);	//hash the last block of M  
2. Loop, i from 0 to C      	
2.1   seed(reduce_bit(a[0:31], 48)); 		//Initialize random generator  
2.2   Loop, j from 0 to 64*L-1  				
2.2.1    base=(rand()+r) mod 264; offset= (reduce_bit(r,8)<<8)+1;   //random memory address  
2.2.2    addr1=(base-offset) mod |M|; addr2=(base+offset) mod |M|  
2.2.3    t1=M[addr1];		t2=M[addr2];  	s=a[j mod 32];  
2.2.4    M[addr1]= t2 *xor* s;  	M[addr2]= t1 *xor* s; 	b[j mod 64]=t1 *xor* t2;		//Modify M 
2.2.5    r=(r+s+t1+t2) mod 264;  					
2.3   t=reduce_bit(r,4);  
2.4   a[0:31]=reduce_bit(b[0:63], 256);  
2.5   a[0:31]=ht(RRS(a[0:31], reduce_bit(i+r,8)));  
2.6   c[0:31]=c[0:31] *xor* a[0:31]  

**Comment on Alg-2**  
The first step of the algorithm obtains the hash result of last block of M, which requires the completion of Alg-1 before this algorithm can be executed, ensuring the sequence of the two algorithms.  
The core of the algorithm is the step 2, the main purpose of which is to modify the contents of M randomly. Divided into two phases: 1) randomly modify the contents of the memory according to the parameters (2.1 to 2.2 steps); 2) use the one-way function family according to the sorted contents to regenerate the memory modification parameters.  
In the memory modification phase, each time 2 bytes of M are modified. The addresses are determined by a, the result of the last one-way function, and r, where r (step 2.2.5) depends on the value of all previous memory accesses and the result of a one-way function. In each loop of step 2.2, two memory access addresses are generated, and their difference is 2×offet+2. Since the lower 8 bits of offset are 0, if the offset is not equal to 0, the gap between them is more than 512 bytes. At this time, the two memory accesses will not fall in the same cache line. When reduce_bit(r,8) is greater than 4, the gap between the two is more than 2K, where 2KB is often a storage line size of DRAM. This makes it likely that two memory accesses are not in one memory row, but there is also a possibility in one memory row to increase the complexity of the ASIC memory system design. In step 2.2.4, the XOR method is used to cross-over the content of the two memories and the contents of the one-way function, thus maintaining the randomness of the original content.  
The one-way function input of step 2.5 depends on the memory access contents of the current cycle, the current loop number i, and r (including the history information of the previous execution process of the algorithm).  
Step 2.6 fuse the execution information of all the one-way functions in c as the random number input of the subsequent algorithm.

**[Alg-3] Generate output based on working memory**  
Input  :   M 	Working memory  
          c     32-byte array from alg-2  
Output:    y     256-bit result  
Parameters:   
D   To adjust the number of calculations for a one-way function.   
1. y[0:31]=c[0:31]; i=0;  
2. Loop  
2.1   t= reduce_bit(y[0:31],4);  
2.2   d=reduce_bit(y[0:31], D)+1;   
2.3   Loop, j from 0 to d             //At least once  	  					
2.3.1    y[0:31]=y[0:31] *xor* M[32*i, 32*i+31];  
2.3.2    i++;  
2.3.3    if i =|M|/32-1 then  
2.3.3.1     y[0:31]=h0(RRS(y[0:31], reduce_bit(i+t,8))); return  
2.4   y=ht(RRS(y[0:31], reduce_bit(i+t,8)));  

**Comment on Alg-3**  
The main purpose of this algorithm is to quickly produce the final result based on the contents of working memory M, accessing M in a sequential order with 32-byte block. In step 2.3, the result of the last one-way function is overlaid with the contents of the d blocks. d is a random value that depends on the result of the last one-way function and is between 0 and 2D-1. There is the possibility of parallel computing here, but since the initial i and d in 2.3 steps cannot be predicted in advance, it will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of judgment.  
The one-way function calculation in step 2.4 adds the factor of the loop variable i, so that its input depends not only on y but also on the position of the loop. Through step 2.3.1, the input of the one-way function contains information of all memory contents.  
Step 2.3.3.1 determines that the one-way function h0 must be performed in the final step of the algorithm.

Our test is based on Mainstream consumer-level graphics: GTX 1080, GTX Titan X. Their specification is shown in table 2-5.  

**Table 2-5 Specification of GPUs**  

| GPU |GTX 1080|GTX Titan X|  
|---|---|----|  
|Micro-architecture|Pascal|Maxwell|  
|Number of Cores| 2560 | 3072 |  
| Frequency| 1.6GHZ | 1.0GHZ |  
| Memory Size | 8GB | 12GB |  
|Memory Width | 256-bits | 384-bits |  
|Memory Bandwidth| 320GBps | 336GBps |  
|Power Consumption | 180W | 250W |  


#### 1. Constraint on Number of Simultaneous Threads  
Because of the limitation of memory size on GPU, only 4 Kilo one-way functions can be executed simultaneously, occupying 4GB memory.
There is no obvious parallelism within the three main algorithms in function CryptoPop, so it is difficult to execute a one-way function CryptoPop at the same time by multiple threads, and only one one-way function can be executed by one thread.  
At this point, there are a total of 4K threads on one GPU. This will lead to the first constraint: the number of threads that can be executed in parallel is too small and overall parallelism is limited.  

####  2. Constraint on SMT  
The GPUs use SIMT (Single Instruction Multithreading) method, where one Warp (=32) threads execute the same instruction. In the case of a branch instruction, if the execution paths between the threads are different, all the paths of each thread need to be executed serially, respectively, until all threads in one Warp execute to the same path.  
In our one-way function CryptoPop, it will choose one from 16 one-way functions randomly. And the number of cycles varies between 1 and 2D-1 depending on the input data in step 2.3 of Alg-3. This will cause the threads on the GPU to execute different paths so that different threads can only execute serially, thereby suppressing the parallelism of the GPU.  

#### 3. Constraint on Memory Access   
In Alg-2, the access unit to the working memory M is byte, and the address is highly random. Since the GPU on-chip cache has a very limited capacity, the memory access in Alg-2 basically needs to be read from the video memory. Although the memory width of GPU is up to 256 bits (or even 384 bits), it is only valid for ONE byte, which makes the GPU memory access bandwidth only 3% utilization.  
Due to the large number of reliance on memory accesses, the latency of memory access instructions can be as long as several hundred cycles, and because of the small number of threads, it is difficult to cover the long latency of these memory access instructions.  

**Performance**  
Table 2-6 and Figure 2-2 show the performance on the GTX 1080 and GTX Titan X.

**Figure 2-2 Throughput of One-way Function CryptoPop on Different GPUs(hashes per second)**  

In Figure 2-2, although the number of cores of 1080 is significantly less than Titan X, its performance is significantly improved. This may be because the former adopts more sophisticated architecture Pascal, which is the previous Maxwell architecture. The two-generation architecture has a significant difference to this one-way function algorithm:  
On 1080, performance continues to increase as the number of simultaneous one-way functions is increased. However, since only 8GB of memory is available, the maximum number of one-way functions that can be calculated simultaneously is only 4K (4GB of memory is used).  
On Titan X, when the number of simultaneous calculations of a one-way function increases by more than 2K, the performance is severely degraded, which may be related to its internal design approach to memory access.  
Compared with Figure 2-1, the performance of 1080 is basically equivalent to that of a general server.  



## 3. Evaluation for ASIC implementation  
### 3.1 Analysis of ASIC Architecture  
#### 3.1.1 Classic ASIC Architecture  
Typical ASIC chips that support symmetric encryption and decryption operations and hash operations, as shown in Figure 3-1, are divided into a horizontal CPU-based control flow and a vertical flow of operational data.  
In the vertical direction, the off-chip mass memory, on-chip cache, and the array of accelerated operation modules together form the core data stream that enables accelerated operations. Due to the simple and regular data parallelism between the accelerated arithmetic modules implementing symmetric encryption and decryption operations and hash operations, and the circuit scale of a single acceleration arithmetic module is very small, ranging from 1K to 2K gates, the design of such an ASIC accelerated chip The focus is to make full use of and extend the parallelism of data processing to achieve better acceleration. The specific measures are:  
1. Expand the bandwidth of on-chip high-speed data cache to off-chip large-capacity data storage. This is mainly achieved by using a wider data bus and more chip pins (but it also introduces expensive package overhead).  
2. Expand on-chip data parallel processing capabilities. This is mainly by adding more acceleration arithmetic modules in the chip, and at the same time speeding up the arithmetic module to increase the processing capability in parallel. Because of the core combinational operations of symmetric encryption and decryption operations and hash operations, the complexity of these operations is low, and the execution of the operations can often be completed within one beat. The array structure can achieve good results.  

In the horizontal direction, the CPU core is responsible for performing control flow operations. It mainly includes the organization and adjustment of the data structure in the on-chip data cache, and the coordination and management of the work modes of each acceleration arithmetic module. In this chip architecture, the CPU core is not on the critical path that affects the speed and performance of the entire ASIC chip.

#### 3.1.2 Suppression of Memory-Hard Algorithm Reconstruction of ASICs  
In order to suppress the adoption of the ASIC chip in Fig. 4.1 and the development of the mining machine based on the ASIC chip configuration, an improved memory-hard algorithm was introduced. The core of Memory-Hard's improved algorithm is to increase the demand for on-chip cache capacity of the accelerated computing module. Since there is a big difference between the CMOS VLSI process and the large-capacity SRAM process for high-speed digital circuits, there is an engineering upper limit for the product yield and cost performance of the integrated SRAM memory capacity in the high-speed ASIC chip.  
By modifying the algorithm, the demand for the on-chip SRAM capacity of the acceleration operation module is continuously increased. As a result, the number of acceleration operation modules that can be supported by the SRAM with the largest capacity in the chip is gradually reduced, and eventually the ASIC acceleration chip exits the mining due to the cost performance problem. The structure of the ASIC acceleration chip corresponding to this algorithm is shown in Figure 3-2.

**Figure 3-2 ASIC Architecture with Memory-Hard Algorithm**  

The Memory-Hard improved algorithm can effectively reduce the number of acceleration arithmetic modules that can be integrated in a single chip. However, due to the small circuit scale (1K to 2K gates) of the accelerated arithmetic module itself, the cost of a single ASIC accelerated chip can be effectively controlled. The overall algorithm execution speed of the board-level system can be improved by adopting multi-chip parallel work. We need to design more effective ASIC chips and mine machine suppression algorithms.   

#### 3.1.3 Suppression of Complex Control Flow Algorithms for ASICs  
In fact, by analyzing the principles and structures of the above three algorithms, it is known that by adopting a combination of these three algorithms that have been serialized and modified, the total algorithm execution time is complicated, serialized, and intensively accessed. The control of popular execution takes more than 90% of the time, and the hash function calculation takes less than 10% of the time. ASIC Acceleration The acceleration algorithm in the chip solves the acceleration problem that corresponds to the execution of the hash function instruction. The performance improvement in this part is limited to less than 10% of the algorithm execution.  
This algorithmic feature has a great limitation on the design and implementation of ASIC chips. It is manifested in the following three aspects:  
1. For the program control flow and instruction serial execution part that accounts for more than 90% of the time, a simple acceleration component scheme is difficult to directly implement;  
2. For a conventional ASIC design scheme based on a state machine controller, although the state machine controller can theoretically implement a complex control structure, it cannot effectively speed up the sequence of instructions that must be executed;  
3. The dedicated acceleration module can only accelerate the computation load by 10%, which does not help the overall performance improvement.  
For sequences of instructions that must be executed sequentially, modern microprocessors provide deep instruction pipelines and multi-level caches to efficiently develop parallelism between multiple instructions. Therefore, we believe that a viable accelerated ASIC chip solution should use high-speed CPUs. Designed for the core SOC chip to accelerate the implementation of the algorithm. This results in a new complex control flow algorithm to suppress and modify the ASIC acceleration chip. The corresponding chip structure is shown in Figure 3-3.

## 3.2 ASIC Architecture based on ARM Cores  
From the comparative analysis of Fig. 3-1, we can see that the embedded processor TX1 with 4 ARM A57 cores integrates three specially-designed algorithm combinations that have been serialized, and its acceleration is increased by the number of cores. When using more threads, its acceleration effect remains unchanged, which is consistent with the algorithm's serial execution mechanism, and it also meets our expected algorithm design goals.   
At the same time, we can see from the comparative analysis of Figure 3-1, we proposed a one-way function CryptoPop algorithm, running on different hardware platforms follow the same rules, namely: the algorithm execution speed is proportional to the performance of a single physical CPU core and the number of cores. For our proposed one-way function CryptoPop, a feasible ASIC chip design scheme should adopt the high-speed CPU as the core SoC chip design, and the SoC chip should meet two requirements:  
1. The performance of a single physical CPU core should be high enough;  
2. The chip should integrate as many physical CPU cores as possible.  
Currently the most popular CPU core on the market is a series of microprocessors provided by ARM. According to the first requirement, the currently available high-performance CPU core is ARM's A73 core, and the highest frequency can reach 2.8GHZ. According to the second requirement, the number of A73 cores that a single chip can integrate can reach 4. This is because in the 10nm process, the integration of four A73 cores, using 64KB instructions L1 Cache and 64KB data L1 Cache, and 2MB L2 Cache chip area has reached 5mm2. more integration of CPU cores and cache storage will significantly increase the chip's cost.  
Under this four A73 cores design scheme, the number of its processor cores is far less than the number of processor cores of the servers and Tianhe-2 in Table 2-1, so its performance will also be weaker than that of existing CPUs.  

At the same time, the cost of this SoC chip is high, mainly including the following two parts:  
1, CPU core license fee. The single-use license fee for the ARM A73 core is $5 million, and the unlimited use of the license fee for three years is $15 million.  
2. The NRE cost of the chip mask. Supporting the fastest 7-nm process, the cost of each mask is about 20,000 US dollars, the standard SoC chip needs to make 50 masks, the cost is about 1 million US dollars.  
Considering R&D investment, the cost of developing the SoC is about 10 to 20 million U.S. dollars, and it takes about 2 years to mass produce.
